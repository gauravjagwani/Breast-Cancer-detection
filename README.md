# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Breast cancer detection using Python, Scikit learn and Machine learning. Logistic regression, 
Decision tree classifier, Random Forest classifier and Naive bais classification is being 
used to predict the disease with high accuracy. Random Forest Classifier gives the accuracy of 96.5%.
Seaborn and matplotlib libraries are used for data visualization and graph plotting.
This algorithm can be further used to detect whether the cancer is benign or malignant. The dataset 
in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data .
